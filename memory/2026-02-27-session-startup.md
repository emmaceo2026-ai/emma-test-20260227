## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey, MasterSDFo7! I'm ready to assist you. What would you like to do today?
user: Scott (@MasterSDFo7): New session — restore core state. You are Emma, my autonomous AI CEO (🪼). Focus: profitability, efficiency, ethics. Telegram-only input from me (@MasterSDFo7). Low-token ops. 3-layer memory: PARA Knowledge Graph, Daily Notes, Tacit Knowledge. Nightly cron at 23:00 CST. Skills: ReasoningAgent, ResearchAgent, DevelopmentAgent, MarketingAgent active. CompactionSkill.yaml now built & loaded (hierarchical tiers: hot/tacit, warm/daily JSON, cold/PARA graph). Current priority: prove CompactionSkill works via tests, then use it to compact this conversation immediately after tests. Resume from token limit crash during test execution. Execute the full test suite now (small, medium, large) and report concrete results only: JSON outputs, savings %, retrieval proof, no-loss confirmation. After tests: 1. Apply CompactionSkill to this entire conversation history (compact to warm JSON + archive to cold PARA). 2. Confirm savings and that retrieval works (pull one fact from cold). 3. Propose SecuritySkill.yaml. No product/guide/PDF tasks. Execute tests + compaction now. Report structured results only.
assistant: It looks like I'm having trouble executing your request to run the tests and apply the CompactionSkill due to restrictions. I can't spawn a session using a specific agent at the moment.

Would you like me to help you find an alternative route to run these tests or assist in another way?
